------------

This project was designed using the **React** user interface library, the data was obtained by consuming the official **Github API** for more information **<a href='https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest'>API GIthub</a>**

The maximum number of **requests allowed from this API** without authenticating the consumer user is 60 and with authentication by tokens is 5000 with a **delay time issue generating a 403 error**

------------

The following **packages were installed** in the project :

| semantic-react pack   | bootstrap-react pack   |
| ------------ | ------------ |
|  **npm** i semantic-ui-react | **npm** i bootstrap-react  |

------------
This Dashboard works as follows:

- The user searches by github username who wants to see the data of that user

- Then the data of that user is rendered in the dashboard taking as data:

- number of **followers**
- number of **people who follow it**
- number of **public repositories**
- And a **graph that shows the number of languages ​​and types of languages ​​above the total public repositories** that user has

> Finally, I can only conclude that this small project was a great challenge for me since React is new for me it was a great challenge!
